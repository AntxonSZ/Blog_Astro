			<h1>🖐🏻 Hello, I'm Antxon Sandez!</h1>
			<p>
				My name real is Andoni Hernádez and I'm in the process of becoming a web developer 🖥️ .
				This is my first blog, using the 🚀 Astro starter template as well as the guide on the official site 🗿.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm exited to share my journey with you, and I hope you enjoy the content I'll be posting.
				If all goes well I'll be able to get my astro badge which I'll post right here in the blog. 😌
			</p>
	
			<p>
				I leave you my social networks at the bottom where you can see my different personal projects, so let's go. 🐱
